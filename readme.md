Applying different filters to the input image

* **cons.py**: Convolution and Sobel; prompts the output
* **hough.py**: Hough Transformation; prompts the output
    + *caveat*: could take up to minute or two

* **canny.py**: Canny filter to get edges
    + saves to 2 files: 'canny-plot.png' 'canny-final.png'
    + also displays the canny-final, along with OpenCV result [very similar results!]
